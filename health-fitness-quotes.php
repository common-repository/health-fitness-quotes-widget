When I can, I take two classes back-to-back.", "The torch relay is an excellent embodiment of all that the Olympic Games have come to symbolise - a celebration of the human spirit.

As the distance and the fatigue really tell, that is when it becomes a proper test of everyone's fitness.", "Almost 70 per cent of your fitness battle is won the day you realise what your body needs and when. I've made my own diets, and I decide for myself what works for me.", "If someone thinks, 'I'll spend the off season working on my fitness and I'll come back a better cricketer,' I don't think that's enough. You need to spend a lot of time working on your skills and honing your skills.", "Ultimately, I'm in the fitness industry. But, I've branched out from there quite a bit. I began doing consulting on writing and getting published in magazines in about 2011. Right around that time, I started doing some angel investing and looking to grow my skills and general experience outside of that.", "I can jog, but I can't run. That's hard for me.

That's my formula.", "A feeble body weakens the mind.", "Practice puts brains in your muscles.", "Health and fitness is who I am.

I like a healthy body.", "A life coach does for the rest of your life what a personal trainer does for your health and fitness.", "You can't get rid of it with exercise alone. You can do the most vigorous exercise and only burn up 300 calories in an hour. If you've got fat on your body, the exercise firms and tones the muscles.

It's the fat!", "A runner must run with dreams in his heart, not money in his pocket.", "On the tennis court, one needs a cool temperament, tremendous ball sense, reflexes, speed, hand-eye co-ordination, power, timing and peak physical fitness.

I love fashion. On the weekends, I try to relax. I have pretty crazy weeks. I like spas and nice dinners. I'm not much of a club person. I like to hang on the beach in Malibu.", "Fitness, defending, the mental stuff - those were all weaknesses of mine. And I turned those into strengths.", "A drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be, according to the fitness and tendency of things. Nature has set upon him the process of decline and dissolution by which she removes things which have survived their usefulness.", "Muscles come and go; flab lasts.", "Family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the '90s version of it.

I try to get at least 8 hours of sleep, drinking a lot of water and exercising.", "Fitness is very important to me because it helps give me a routine when I travel.

With a good mixture of fitness and healthy food I always feel great!", "My mother was a P.E. teacher, and she was kind of a fanatic about fitness and nutrition growing up, so it was ingrained in me at a young age. As I get older, I'm finding out it's not about getting all buffed up and looking good. It's more about staying healthy and flexible.", "Training is such a vital part of preparation for a game, you really do train to play. It tops up your ability, like sharpening a carving knife.

I wanted to lose some weight. So I've been doing Pilates and yoga, trying to lean out my body so I won't be bulky.", "I suffer panic attacks which has made me really conscious about my fitness and I have become addicted to jogging.

Once I get the physical stuff out of the way it always seems like I have more calmness and better self-esteem.", "Linguistics is a good way of defining the culture of a brand.

That also happens to be the time required to get used to eating less. In other words, if you can get past day three of a fitness regimen, things improve.", "For years, I always thought it was hilarious that I was this fitness guru, because fitness was just a tool I utilized to help people improve their confidence. For me, it's never been about fitness. It's always been about helping to empower people.", "I'm quite into fitness, and I have a fantastic personal trainer who knows me, knows my body, knows when to push me, and knows when not to push me. She doesn't make me do 20 burpees in a row and instead focuses on strengthening my core, telling me we need to focus on making me into 'a tall giraffe'!", "What's wrong with extreme dieting and hard-core fitness plans is that they don't take into account the rest of your life.", "Yoga disciplines both the mind and the souls and not just your body. It helps me in having a constant positive outlook in life. I would love my family to adopt this form of fitness as well.", "Staying more controlled mentally stemmed from taking my fitness more seriously. When you're doing track work, sprints and so on, it's pretty painful, but that does make you feel better prepared and therefore mentally stronger when you're going into a match. You know, without a doubt, that you are strong enough to last.", "As a father, my first priority is to help my sons set and attain personal goals so they will develop self-confidence and individual strength.

I wanted to lose weight; I didn't anticipate the serenity. Being in motion, suddenly my body was busy and so my head could work out some issues I had swept under a carpet of wine and cheese. Good therapy, that's a good run.", "The spirit of the Olympic movement is great for young people because it teaches them about the training and discipline required to compete.

Give me just this and I'll prove I can make you a new man.", "My experience as a school nurse taught me that we need to make a concerted effort, all of us, to increase physical fitness activity among our children and to encourage all Americans to adopt a healthier diet that includes fruits and vegetables, but there is more.", "I would like to thank everyone who supported me to be fit for the Euros. I had some fitness problems before the tournament, but I am here now!", "Sexy is attitude, but fitness for me is my dance. I dance two hours nearly every day. You break into good sweat, and it doesn't even feel like exercise. Apart from that, I enjoy Pilates.", "Never, ever exercise in front of a TV or while reading. You lose 50 percent of the benefit of the exercise by not hearing and feeling your heart rate, your sweat and the pain levels that need to be encountered in fitness training.", "I do yoga, I do Bikram and I run, and I eat really healthy.", "What's important is to get into shape and then not to have to worry about it. I don't want to get on stage and not being able to do something. Not being physically fit doesn't work for me.", "It's not like I was trying to be sexy but I had to get fit because I had to be able to do stunts.

It's about being fit for life.", "I'm French, so I'm quite lazy about exercising, and I smoke. But I do love going for a run in the morning with my dog. That's all.", "Find fitness with fun dancing. It is fun and makes you forget about the dreaded exercise.", "I would say 90 percent of the stuff we do is technical anyway. If you look at a two-hour training day, 12 minutes are probably spent running or gaining fitness.", "In my view, fitness training isn't that important in England, as they all train with such intensity anyway and have a competitive edge when just sprinting. The matches are all hard-fought, too.", "My church has a health and fitness ministry to encourage our members to take care of spiritually and physically; how could I not?", "With fitness, I do Bikrams hot yoga. The gym that I have in my building is amazing. I love to do cardio and weights there.", "I don't lift weights. I do fitness exercises to stay strong.", "My priority is to turn people - especially kids - on to sports and being active so they don't even have to think about it being good for their health. If people participate for the fun of it, and believe me - it is fun, then fitness programs will be much more successful.", "For me, triathlons were something that was down to me and my fitness. Now, I really enjoy the pain in the triathlon of chasing someone down.

'Strictly Come Dancing' in 2008 was great for my fitness.", "It is really important that we get more women doing exercise and being active, and those that have taken up boxing or boxing training will definitely find that it has a really positive impact on their health, fitness and well-being.", "I think it'd be wonderful if we could train young girls to be active in lots of ways and that they then wouldn't have to age at the same rate that they would if they were not more active. In other words, more physical fitness and not just the sporty kind, but the yoga, which is really important.", "I grew up watching Salman Khan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who have always juggled fitness with acting. In real life, I'm a fitness freak. Besides, it is nice to look at an actor who is fit, and if you become a role model, that's a perk.", "Fitness is defined differently by everyone, but for me, the most important thing is being healthy. As tennis players, what we do is not the healthiest thing. We almost abuse our bodies.", "Obviously, when you're doing fitness work at a club all week and every week, it's all about specific drills for what you need to do on the pitch. So I'd be doing a different drill to the centre-midfielders. It's all specifically tailored for me. For example, my drills are high speed. It's all about trying to break the line with a sharp sprint.", "I'd love to look like my mum when I am her age. She taught ballet for years, and my attitude to exercise and fitness has definitely been influenced by her. She's 84 now, and I've watched how well she has aged, and a lot of that is to do with her fantastic posture.", "Sometimes fitness is a good thing to have, but you have to recognise that fitness takes you only so far, and skills are the most important thing. Fitness just helps you execute those cricketing skills for longer and more consistently, maybe.", "Overall, I think I'm in pretty good shape, but I'm not really someone that is gung-ho or a fitness fanatic.", "When 'Men's Health' reached out and said, 'Will you be on the 'Today Show' and do a fitness challenge?' I said, 'OK. I'm not showing them anything they don't already know.'

Having strength, stamina and speed is important because I'm working with dogs who can kill me.", "I'm not a waif-y girl and never will be.

We have weekly check-ins and a reward system - and group penalties if one of us slacks off.", "We talk a lot on 'Biggest Loser' about how fitness is a natural antidepressant, how it burns off stress.

I'm always controlled because I do a lot of fitness and triathlons, not just Formula One, so I always make sure I eat the right things.", "When I started out as a model, I took things for granted. Because I bagged work thanks to my looks, I didn't give my body any importance. I was a couch potato who'd eat anything. Then, in 2005, a tabloid ran a story calling me fat. I thought, 'I'm famous. How can I be fat?' It was a slap. I decided to get fit.", "I like starting off the new year fresh. I'm excited to see how 2013 turns out.

Actually, more of a fatness video.", "When I was first introduced to CrossFit, I found it to be the hardest workout that I'd ever done.

Women are going to appreciate that.", "I'm really into fitness, so my hobbies are yoga, Pilates, and working out.", "Dance never really goes away; it just reforms and reinvents, and it's become more athletic with new connection to fitness and sport. Dance used to have this exclusivity, but not any more.", "I just have to express myself somehow, either through singing, dance or fitness. You get sick of it; you have days where you think you don't want to do it, but generally after I've done something, I feel better.
